# Mission-Demolition
## Project Overview

Mission Demolition is a 3D physics-based game where players use a slingshot to launch projectiles and demolish castles. The game offers multiple levels, a scoring system, and a skin shop where players can purchase different skins for their projectiles using points earned in-game.

## Basic Functionality

**Projectile Launching**: Players use the slingshot to launch projectiles towards a castle to achieve the objective.

**Level Progression**: The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Progression to the next level occurs upon meeting the goal conditions.

**Scoring System**: Players earn points based on performance and can use them to purchase skins in the shop.

**Follow Cam**: A dynamic camera system follows the projectile, offering views of both the slingshot and the castle.

**Skin Shop**: Players can use points to purchase and apply different skins to their projectiles.

**Visual Enhancements**: The game features cloud cover, textured walls and slabs, and skin customization for projectiles.

## How to Play

**Launching a Projectile**: 
1. Hover over the slingshot to activate it.
2. Click and drag to set the launch power and direction.
3. Release to fire the projectile towards the castle.

**Switching Views**:
Use the view switcher to toggle between slingshot, castle, and both views.

**Earning Points**:
1. Complete levels by hitting the castle with a projectile.
2. The score is displayed in the shop to buy skins.

**Buying Skins**:
1. Open the shop from the UI.
2. Select a skin if enough points are available.
3. Enjoy the new look of your projectile!

## Future Improvements

Implementing additional levels and challenges.

Adding more skin options and possibly skins for other objects in the game.

Enhancing the shop UI with visual effects and animations.
